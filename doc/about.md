# About CloudSped 

CloudSpec is an open source tool for validating your resources in your cloud providers using a logical language that
everybody can understand. With its reasonably simple syntax, you can validate the configuration of your cloud resources,
avoiding mistakes that can lead to availability or confidentiality issues.

With CloudSpec you validate resources in your cloud provider. A resource can be anything, from an EC2 Instance to an SES
rule. Anything that a CloudSpec provider implements.
